## Technical Details
- Built with Manifest V3
- Uses Chrome's modern APIs (chrome.scripting)
- Implements smart cookie validation
- Handles various cookie formats and properties

## Limitations and Future Features
- **Cookie Duration Modification**: The current version does not support modifying cookie durations directly through the UI. The extension preserves the original expiration dates during import if they are still valid, otherwise, it creates session cookies.
- **Cookie Editing**: Individual cookie editing features will be implemented in future versions.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Future versions may include filtering options for exports and batch operations.
- **Enhanced Security**: Additional security features for cookie storage and transfer are planned.

## Security Note
- Cookies are exported without encryption
- Use caution when sharing cookie files
- Some websites may have additional security measures
- Special cookies (__Host-) are automatically skipped for security
